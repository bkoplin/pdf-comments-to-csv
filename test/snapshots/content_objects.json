If we 1\\rwill be making the argum\\\rent that the rate decrease is too big to absorb in one year, then I don't think we can dismiss the prior\\ryear's rate overstatement as TMA's problem. TMA could say the prior rates were overstated by 10%, so the proposed decrease of I\\r10% is not too big. \\\rI think a better approach would be to say there are many assumptions that go into the ceiling rate calculations\\rand actual experience could differ. Although the risk score calculation was an error not an assumption, there was no bias to the\\rresults \\(yo\\\ru wouldn't know how it would impact each plan unless you recalculated the risk scores\\), thus can be considered like an\\rassumption for this discussion. Recalculating risk scores would be similar to revising trend in hindsight knowing the actual results.\\r\\\rThen we can treat the prior rates as valid and the change from them for this year also would be a valid concern of the plans.\\rI think the memo from Milliman is fine."
